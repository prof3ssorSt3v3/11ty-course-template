## Late Policy

For the exact due dates and times for any deliverable, see the assignment page in BS LMS.

<div class="danger">
  <span class="ttl">Late Penalty</span>
  Program late penalty for deliverables.

- Up to one day late -10%
- Up to two days late -20%
- Three to ten days late -30%
- After 10 days assignments are given a grade of zero. They can still be submitted for feedback but are worth no marks.

Late penalty percentages are calculated based on the total possible value of the assignment, not the grade for the work.

</div>

## Extensions

Any request for an extension on an assignment must be made at least the day before the assignment is due.

Requests for extensions can be made via email to your instructor and must include a valid reason for the extension. Simply running out of time or poor time management is not a valid excuse.

If you have no valid reason for an extension, consider the mental health extension option.

## Mental Health Extensions for Assignments

Once per semester you can request a 3-day extension on a single assignment. This extension does not change the due date for the assignment, nor does it change the date of the 10 day limit for assignment
late submissions. This extension just provides immunity from the late penalty for 3 days. After the 3rd day, the full late penalty applies.

To apply for one of these extensions you do not need to provide an excuse, just post a submission through BS LMS on the Assignments page, to the Mental Health Extension item with a note saying which
assignment you want to apply the extension to.

Extension requests must be made before the assignment deadline.

No extensions can be given to the final project.

These extensions apply to all other assignments, unless otherwise indicated by the instructor.

## Global Requirements

For all assignment deliverables, you need to make sure that all aspects are available to your instructor.

This means that you MUST provide all of the following, as applies to each assignment.

1. Submit link to private Github Repository through BS LMS
2. Submit link to public website URL (such as Github.io, Vercel, or Netlify) through BS LMS
3. Invite your instructor to the private Github Repository
4. TEST your public website URL to make sure it loads without being logged in.

It is your responsibility to make sure that all of these tasks are completed for each assignment by the due date.
